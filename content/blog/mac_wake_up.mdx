# Power Management Settings Summary

Based on the commands I've run, here's an overview of your Mac's power management settings:

## Current Power Settings
- The system is currently on AC power with a fully charged internal battery (100%)
- Sleep is enabled (sleep=1) but is currently being prevented by:
  - bluetoothd: Running a process that is preventing idle system sleep
  - powerd: Preventing sleep while the display is on

## Sleep-Related Settings
- Sleep timer: 1 minute after inactivity
- Display sleep: 10 minutes after inactivity
- Disk sleep: 10 minutes after inactivity
- Standby mode: Enabled (standby=1)
- Hibernate mode: 3 (Safe sleep - writes memory to disk and keeps memory powered)

## Active Assertions
- UserIsActive: Currently active (likely due to recent user input)
- PreventUserIdleSystemSleep: Active due to bluetoothd (Bluetooth stack) and powerd
- USB assertions: Two USB hubs are connected and preventing some sleep features

## Other Settings
- Power Nap: Enabled (powernap=1)
- Low Power Mode: Disabled (lowpowermode=0)
- Wake On Magic Packet: Disabled (womp=0)
- TCP Keep Alive: Enabled (tcpkeepalive=1)

If you're experiencing issues with your Mac not sleeping properly, the main culprits appear to be:
1. Bluetooth services (likely connected devices staying active)
2. Power management service preventing sleep while display is on
3. Connected USB hubs that might be preventing deeper sleep states

To adjust these settings, you can use the `pmset` command with sudo privileges, or use System Settings (or System Preferences) → Battery/Energy Saver.

## 停用睡眠後背景活動
```bash
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
```
