# Introduce

### The operating system needs to somehow share the physical CPU among many jobs running seemingly at the same time
- run one process for a little while, then run another one, and so forth
- By time-sharing the CPU in this manner, virtualization is achieved

### A few challenges in building such virtualization machinery
- The first is performance
  - how can we implement virtualization without adding excessive overhead to the system?
- The second is control
  - how can we run processes efficiently while retaining control over the CPU?

# Limited Direct Execution

## Basic direct execution protocol
| OS                            | Program                  | 
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Create entry for process list |                          |  
| Allocate memory for program   |                          |   
| Load program into memory      |                          |   
| Set up stack with argc/argv   |                          |  
| Clear registers               |                          |  
| Execute call main()           |                          |  
|                               | Run main()               |   
|                               | Execute return from main |  
| Free memory of process        |                          |   
| Remove from process list      |                          |

### few problems in our quest to virtualize the CPU
- 該如何確保運行的程序不會做出我們不期望的事情,但任然是非常有效率的
- When we are running the process, how does the os stop it from running and switch to another process

# Problem Restricted Operations
- What if the process wishes to perform some kind of restricted`限制` operation

## How to perform restricted operations
- A process must be able to perform I/O and some other restricted operations, but without giving the process complete control over the system.
  How can the OS and hardware work together to do so?

- if we wish to build a file system that checks permissions before granting access to file
  - if we simply any user process issue IO to the disk, a process could simply read or write the entire disk, and thus all protections would be lost

## User mode
- we can run in user mode is restricted in what it can do
  - for example, we are running in user mode; a process cannot issue IO requests; if we did, the os will kill the process

### Introduce
- user mode is kernel mode, which the operating system or kernel runs in. 
  - In this mode, code that runs can do what it likes

## However, what should a user process dfo when it wishes to perform time kind of privileged operation?
- virtually all modern hardware provides the ability for user programs to perform a system call.
  - to execute a system call, a program must execute a special **trap** instruction

### Trap instruction
- this instruction simultaneously jumps into the kernel and raises the privilege level to kernel mode
  - in kernel mode, the system can perform whatever privileged operations are needed, and thus do the required work for the calling process
  - when finished, the os calls ap special return-from-trap instruction, returns into the calling user program while simultaneously reducing the privilege level back to user mode

- when we perform the trap instruction, the system must be careful.
  - for example, the process will push the program counter, flags, ad a few other registers onto a per-process kernel stack
  - the return-from-trap will pop these values off the stack and resume execution of the user mode program

### How Does the trap know which code to run inside the os?
- the calling process cannot specify an address to jump to. to jump anywhere into the kernel which clearly is a **Very Bad Idea**
#### Trap Table
- the kernel does so by setting up a trap table at boot time. When the machine boots up, it does so in privileged or kernel mode
- One of the first things is
  - tell the hardware what code to run when certain exceptional events occur. Once the hardware is informed, it remembers the location of these handlers until the machine is next rebooted
- to specify the exact system call, a **system-call number** is usually assigned to each system call. it is valid the number when handling the system call inside the trap handler, and if it is, executes the corresponding code.
- This level of indirection serves as a from of protection; user code cannot specify an exact address to jump to 
- Trap table is a very powerful capability, it is also a privileged operation.

### What horrible things could you do to a system if you could install your own trap table? Could you take over the machine?
![](../../public/tt.jpeg)

- In the first, the kernel initializes trap table, and the CPU remembers its location for subsequent use
- In the second, the kernel sets up a few things before using a return-from-trap instruction to start th execution of the process
  - switches the CPU to user mode and begins running the process.
- When the process wishes to issue a system call,it turns back into the OS, which handles it and once again returns control via a return-from-trap
  to the process.
- The process then completes its work, and returns from main; At this point,OS cleans up, and we are done

## Use Protected control Transefer
- The hardware assists the OS by providing different modes of execution.
  - In user mode, applications do not have full access to hardware resources.
  - In kernel mode, the OS has access to the full resources of the machine.
- Special instructions to trap into the kernel and return-from-trap back to
  user-mode programs are also provided, as well as instructions that allow
  the OS to tell the hardware where the trap table resides in memory.
