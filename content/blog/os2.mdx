# Introduce

## How to create and control a process
- Unix presents one of the most ways to create a new process
  - fork
  - exec
- A process can use a thread routine to wait for a process it has created to complete
  - wait

# The fork System Call
- the fork system call is used to create a new process
  ```c
  #include "os.h"

  int main(int argc,char *argv[]){
      printf("hello world (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
      int rc = fork();
      if (rc < 0){
          fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
          exit(1);
      }else if(rc == 0){
          printf("hello, I am child of %d (pid:%d)\n",rc, (int) getpid());
      }else{
          printf("hello, I am parent of %d (pid:%d)\n", rc, (int) getpid());
      }
      return 0;
  }
  ```
- the process is created is an **exact copy of the calling process**
- the new process which parent creates we called it child process, and it does not run at the main function, and the child process is not an exact copy

# The wait System call
## Call fork and Wait
- if you have waited here, the parent will wait for the child to finish and continue to execute a parent process even the parent process runs first, it will wait the child process to finish, and return wait
- for this example, we can know that the child will always print first
- if the parent does happen to run first,it will immediately call wait; thus system call will not return until the child has run and exited
  ```c
  #include "os.h"

  int main(){
      printf("hello world (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
      int rc = fork();
      if (rc < 0){
          fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
          exit(1);
      }else if(rc == 0){
          printf("hello, I am child of %d (pid:%d)\n",rc, (int) getpid());
      }else{
          int rc_wait = wait(NULL);
          printf("hello, I am parent of %d (rc_wait = %d) (pid:%d)\n", rc,rc_wait, (int) getpid());
      }
  }
  ```
# The exec system call
- this system call is useful when you want to run a program that is different from the calling program.
- for example, calling fork is only useful if you want to keep running copies of the same program. However, often you want to run a **different** program, exec does just that
  ```c
  #include "os.h"
    int main(int argc,char *argv[]){
      printf("hello world (pid:%d)\n", (int) getpid());
      int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0){
      fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
      exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
      printf("hello, I am child of %d (pid:%d)\n",rc, (int) getpid());
      char *myargs[3];
      // execvp is  guaranteed not to modify those strings so if not use strdup is ok
      // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69505245/why-is-strdup-used-here
      myargs[0] = strdup("wc");
      myargs[1] = strdup("p3.c");
      myargs[2] = NULL;
      execvp(myargs[0], myargs);
      printf("this shouldn't print out");
    }else{
      int rc_wait = wait(NULL);
      printf("hello, I am parent of %d (rc_wait = %d) (pid:%d)\n", rc,rc_wait, (int) getpid());
    }
  }
  ```
  - What it does: first, given the name of an executable`(e.g.,,wc)`, and some arguments`(e.g.,p3.c)`,it loads code `and static data` from that executable and overwrites its current code segment `and static data`
  - the heap and stack and other parts of the memory space of the program are re-initialized

# Motivating the API
- the shell is just a user program. It shows you a prompt and then waits for you to type something into it
- This example lets the output of the program wc is redirected into the output file
  ```c
  #include "os.h"

  int main(int argc,char **argv){
      int rc = fork();
      if(rc < 0){
          fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
          exit(1);
      }else if (rc == 0){
          close(STDOUT_FILENO);
          open("./p4.output",O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC,S_IRWXU);

          //exec wc
          char *myargs[3];
          myargs[0] = strdup("wc");
          myargs[1] = strdup("p4.c");
          myargs[2] = NULL;
          execvp(myargs[0],myargs);
      }else{
          int rc_wait = wait(NULL);
      }

      return 0;
  }
  ```
# Process Control And Users
- Beyond fork,exec,and wait,there are a lot of other interfaces for interacting with a process in a Unix system
- In most Unix shells, certain keystroke combinations are configured to deliver a specific signal to the currently running process

## What is root
- users generally can only control their iwn processes but root can control all process
- for example, while most users cannot kill other users process, the superuser can.


# Key Process API Terms
- Each process has a name; in most systems, that name is a number
known as a process ID (PID).


- The `fork()` system call is used in UNIX systems to create a new process. The creator is called the parent; the newly created process is
called the child. As sometimes occurs in real life,the child
process is a nearly identical copy of the parent.


- The `wait(I)` system call allows a parent to wait for its child to complete execution.


- The `exec()` family of system calls allows a child to break free from
its similarity to its parent and execute an entirely new program.


- A UNIX shell commonly uses `fork()`, `wait()`, and `exec()` to
launch user commands; the separation of fork and exec enables features like input/output redirection, pipes, and other cool features,
all without changing anything about the programs being run.


- Process control is available in the form of signals, which can cause
jobs to stop, continue, or even terminate.

- Which processes can be controlled by a particular person is encapsulated`封裝的` in the notion of a user; the operating system allows multiple
users onto the system, and ensures users can only control their own
processes.


- A superuser can control all processes `(and indeed do many other
things)`; this role should be assumed infrequently and with caution
for security reasons.

# Homework
## Package
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
```
## 1.
-  Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main
   process access a variable `(e.g., x)` and set its value to something `(e.g., 100).`
   What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int x = 100;
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0){
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        x = 200;
        fprintf(stdout, "Child: x = %d\n", x);
    }else{
        x = 300;
        fprintf(stdout, "Parent: x = %d\n", x);
        wait(NULL);
    }
}
```
## 2.
- Write a program that opens a file `(with the open() system call)` and then
  calls `fork()`to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by open()? What happens when they are
  writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        close(STDOUT_FILENO);
        open("./p5.output",O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC,S_IRWXU);

        char *myargs[3];
        myargs[0] = strdup("wc");
        myargs[1] = strdup("p5.c");
        myargs[2] = NULL;
        execvp(myargs[0], myargs);
    }else{
        close(STDOUT_FILENO);
        open("./p5.output",O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC,S_IRWXU);
    }
}
```
## 3.
- Write another program using `fork()`. The child process should print `“hello”`;
  the parent process should print “`goodbye”`. You should try to ensure that
  the child process always prints first; can you do this without calling `wait()` in
  the parent?
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        printf("hello\n");
    }else{
        exit(1);
    }

    rc = fork();
    if (rc > 0){
        printf("goodbye\n");
        exit(1);
    }

}
```
## 4.
-  Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of` exec()` to
   run the program `/bin/ls`.
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        char *myargs[3];
        myargs[0] = strdup("ls");
        myargs[1] = strdup("-l");
        myargs[2] = NULL;
        // execvp(myargs[0], myargs);
        execlp(myargs[0],myargs[0],myargs[1]);
    }else{
        int rc_wait = wait(NULL);
    }
}
```
## 5.
- Now write a program that uses `wait()`to wait for the child process to finish
  in the parent. What does` wait()`return? What happens if you use `wait()`
  in the child?
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int rc = fork();
    printf("hello %d\n",getpid());
    if(rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        printf("hello child %d\n",getpid());
        int child_wait = wait(NULL);
        printf("%d\n",child_wait);
    }else{
        int rc_wait = wait(NULL);
        printf("%d",rc_wait);
    }
}
// wait 會return child process的pid
// 在child 中的wait不會觸發,並且值為-1,猜測是因為child process已經結束了所以不會wait任何底下的process
```
## 6.
- Write a slight modification of the previous program, this time using `waitpid()`
  instead of `wait()`. When would `waitpid()`be useful?
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        printf("hello\n");
    }else{
        waitpid(rc,NULL,0);
        printf("goodbye\n");
    }
}

```

## 7.
- Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child closes
  standard output `(STDOUT FILENO)`. What happens if the child calls `printf()`
  to print some output after closing the descriptor?
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }else if(rc == 0){
        close(STDOUT_FILENO);
        printf("hello\n");
    }else{
        exit(1);
    }
}
```
## 8.
- Write a program that creates two children, and connects the standard output
     of one to the standard input of the other, using the `pipe()`system call.
```c
#include "os.h"

int main(){
    int p[2];
    int msg_size = 5;
    if(pipe(p) < 0){
        fprintf(stderr, "pipe failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    char buf[msg_size];
    write(p[1],"hello",msg_size);

    read(p[0],buf,msg_size);
    printf("%s\n",buf);

    close(p[0]);
    close(p[1]);
}
```
